<h2 id="finite-maps-record-sets-and-the-initial-map.">Finite maps, record sets and the initial map.</h2>
<p>In the type system of Haskell, there is no subtyping. There are some roundabout ways to provide type safe subtypes though. Notably, when the predicate is defined ahead of time <em>(example: strictly ascending lists — a representation of sets — as a subtype of all lists)</em>, abstract types with smart constructors may be used. When a predicate is variable or arbitrary, there is no way to express the subtypes thus obtained in the type system. But we can still think of them as living in the category <strong>Set</strong> of sets and total functions — only in Haskell we shall have to use partial functions instead.</p>
<p>A special case is finite sets. We can store all values of a finite set, and we can define a finite map pointwise. It would, again, appear partial in the type system of Haskell, but it is total on a known finite set of keys, so we can always check that a given <em>«unsafe»</em> access is valid. Nevertheless, I am going to concede to the type system and speak of finite maps on subtypes as if they are partial maps between the usual Haskell types. For such finite sets and maps, we have ready-made definitions in <code>containers</code>.</p>
<p>I introduce a synonym <em>α ⇸ β</em> for a partial map <code>Data.Map.Map α β</code> for ease of reading. Note that these arrows compose. It is not feasible to define an identity map in Haskell, but we can imagine that it is there and say that there is a category of finite maps. Composition is also broken in the presence of non-trivial equality of key sets, but I am going to ignore that as well because we only use trivial equality where a value is equal to itself and nothing else.</p>
<p>I also use a notation <em>{A}</em> for a finite set of values of type <em>A</em>, so there is a monic arrow <em>{A} → A</em> — this is analogous to the usual notation <em>[A]</em> for a list.</p>
<p>There is another, type safe way in Haskell to represent sets, but only of known size — as record types. If a set is represented this way, type safe projections are gained for free. A curious example is a fully general record, where each field is its own type variable. Such records are used extensively in our Opaleye code. You may consider a monomorphic record as a <em>«column set»</em> of a table, with typing judgement associated to every column.</p>
<p>Particularly, a table in a data base contains a set of identically typed monomorphic records that we can extract. All the work we are going to do will be with such a record set. It is the most informative entity we can possibly have, so in some sense it is an initial object in the subcategory of <strong>Set</strong> that we concern ourselves with.</p>
<p>Assume a type synonym <em>Γ</em> for the type of records, so <em>x: Γ</em> is a single entry in the data base. An identity arrow on a record set has the type <em>Γ ⇸ Γ</em> — it is defined on a known subtype of <em>Γ</em> and nowhere else. Looks boring, but see that you may use <em>fmap (projection: Γ → X)</em> to transform this map into <em>Γ ⇸ X</em> — an easy way to turn Haskell functions <em>Γ → α</em> into finite maps! This is why the identity map on the initial object is central to our work here.</p>
<h2 id="fiber-inverse-lattice-of-projections-and-lattice-of-equivalence-classes.">Fiber inverse, lattice of projections and lattice of equivalence classes.</h2>
<p>Any projection <em>f: Γ ⇸ X</em> has a finite range that we may recognize as a finite subtype <em>X’ ⊂ X</em>, so that the projection may be thought of as an epic arrow <em>Γ’ → X’</em> in the category of finite sets and total maps. Any epic arrow is a quotient map for the source, so it induces a slicing of the source into equivalence classes. We may obtain this slicing in Haskell as <em>f⁻¹: X ⇸ {Γ}</em>. I call it <em>«fiber inverse»</em> because the equivalence classes are the fibers of the projection <em>f</em>.</p>
<p>What does this practically mean? For example, take the standard table <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/infoschema-columns.html"><code>information_schema.columns</code></a> — this table describes all the columns of all other tables in the data base, with their types, nullability and so on. It has a column <code>table_schema</code>. If we project along this column with <em><code>table_schema</code>: Γ → type of <code>table_schema</code></em>, the fiber inverse <em><code>table_schema</code> ⇸ {Γ}</em> is a classification of columns by the table schema which tables they are columns of. Similarly with the column <code>table_name</code>.</p>
<p>Now apply fiber inverse to <code>table_schema</code> first and then map the application of <code>table_name</code> over the result. Since a fiber inverse has finite sets <em>{Γ}</em> as their target type, this is perfectly legal and gives <em><code>table_schema</code> ⇸ <code>table_name</code> ⇸ {Γ}</em> — a classification of columns by schema and table! In other words, every <em>{Γ}</em> here is a finite set of columns in a given table of a given schema. See also that we have the complete record type in the end, so we can study it further — there is no loss of information.</p>
<p>Since we consider finite maps to be a subcategory of <strong>Set</strong>, which is cartesian closed, we may curry, uncurry, partially apply and overall feel like home. In particular, the map we obtained is the same as <em>⟨<code>table_schema</code>, <code>table_name</code>⟩ ⇸ {Γ}</em> and we may add any number of projections here.</p>
<p>You can see from here that the lattice of subsets of the column set corresponds to the fiber inverses we may take and induces a lattice structure on the latter. For example, <em>⟨<code>table_schema</code>, <code>table_name</code>⟩ ⇸ {Γ}</em> is a <em>«finer»</em> fiber inverse than <em><code>table_schema</code> ⇸ {Γ}</em>. So what does it mean for one fiber inverse to be <em>«finer»</em> than another? It means that the equivalence classes the former slices the source into are all subsets of the equivalence classes of the latter. So, for example, the set of columns in a table is a subset of the columns of the schema the table belongs to. We find that the lattice of equivalence classes and refinements of a record set of a table corresponds to the lattice of subsets of the column set of that table.</p>
